# PodHarbour
Group project with Holly, Lewis, and Jack

# What is this?
This was a one-week JavaScript group project.
The brief was to make a Podcast web application, where a user could browse, listen to and subscribe to podcasts.
The project is made up of a client (using React + Vite) and a backend server (using Express).

# How to set this up on your local machine:
This project will require Node and Mongosh set up on your machine.
There are parts to this project - the client and the server (backend).
Both will require you to their directories npm install the required packages.
The server will require you to run the seed file first (which can be done by going into the server directory and using npm run seeds).
To run the server/client, they both use the command: npm run dev.

By Default, the server will run on port 9000 and the client will run on port 5173.
